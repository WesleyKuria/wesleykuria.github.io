Education: My academic journey and qualifications

Tech Used
Just the basics for now:

HTML5

CSS3 (with some cool animations)

Vanilla JavaScript

About This Project
I built this for the PLP Academy Portfolio Challenge (Feb 2025 cohort). It's my first proper attempt at a portfolio site and I'm pretty proud of how it turned out!


Next Steps

Include blog section

Maybe try a React version later
